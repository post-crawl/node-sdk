## Tips

1. **API Key Security**: Never commit your API key to version control
2. **Rate Limits**: Check `client.rateLimitInfo` to monitor your usage
3. **Error Handling**: Always wrap API calls in try/catch blocks
4. **Platform Detection**: Use type guards (`isRedditPost`, `isTiktokPost`) for type-safe access

## Customization

Feel free to modify these examples for your use case:
- Change search queries
- Add different URLs to extract
- Modify response modes (raw vs markdown)
- Adjust result counts and pagination
